SuperStore: Returns Analysis
What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore? 
In this project, I have prepared an analysis for the CEO of the Superstore to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders 
and how to reduce the volume of returned orders.
Based upon the findings: Three categories have the highest return rates (Binders / Papers / Phones) , while three customers are responsible for the high 
return rates in these three categories. I have also found that the West Coast region attributes not only to the highest density of sales but 
also is responsible for the highest return rates. ( California is the biggest benefactor for sales but also has the highest return rate out of all the regions)
Interesting enough, the data also showed that returns are highest during three specific months (March / September / December).
